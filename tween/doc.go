/*
Package tween provides primitives useful for [tweening].

Specifically, the core primitive for creating discretized
sequences out of parametric space curves.
The space curves are expressed as parametric functions of a single
parameter defined over the closed interval [0, 1].

This package also includes some common useful utilities
related to [tweening], like easing functions.
