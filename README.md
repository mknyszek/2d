# 2d

2d is a composable collection of utility packages for 2D graphics.

Everything under the `ebiten` directory depends on the Ebiten game engine
and is designed to work with it.
Everything else can be used in more general contexts.

See the documentation for each package.

## Compatibility

## Disclaimer

This project has the Go license, but this project is neither an official
Google product nor an official Go package.
I just work on the Go team and it's the easiest way to cover my work.
I do not work on this as part of my job, this is purely a hobby project.
Do not expect support.
I may respond to issues and PRs, but do not expect me to.
This is for fun.
